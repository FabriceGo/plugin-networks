Here you find all the configuration of your equipment :

-   **Name de l'Ã©quipement Networks** : name of your Networks equipment,
-   **Parent object** : indicates the parent object to which the equipment belongs,
-   **Category** : equipment categories (it can belong to several categories),
-   **Activate** : makes your equipment active,
-   **Visible** : makes your equipment visible on the dashboard,
-   **IP adress** : IP address to ping,
-   **MAC address (wol)** : MAC address for wake-on-lan,
-   **Broadcast IP (wol)** : network broadcast IP address to send wake-on-lan,
-   **Ping method** : Choice of ping method : IP (normal), ARP (preferred for phones or peripherals that fall asleep), PORT (to test if a port is open)
-   **TTL** : Time-to-live, values can be : 
    - 0 : same host
    - 1 : same subnets
    - 32 : same site
    - 64 : same region
    - 128 : same continent
    - 256 : no limit
    If you have a 'Time to live exceeded' error, increase this value. If empty, then the parameter is 255. Note that on some configuration (Docker for example) the 255 is not authorized so it is necessary to decrease this value.
-   **Port** : Port to ping if you are in ping mode on a port (example : 8080 for 192.168.0.12:8080),
-   **Self-updating (cron)** : cron defining the ping frequency,
